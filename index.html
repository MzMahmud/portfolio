              Software Engineer with 2 years of experience in web development
              with professional experience in designing and implementing
              efficient, highly available, scalable and maintainable backend,
              clean responsive, and accessible UI. Self-organized learner with a
              strong sense of responsibility and growth mindset. Proficient in
              effective collaboration and communication with people from
              different backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born in Chittagong, Bangladesh. I spent my very early
              childhood in Chittagong. Then, up to primary school, I was in
              Dhaka. My high school life was in Jashore, and finally, I spent my
              university life in Dhaka. This constant shifting was due to my
              father being a military person. Therefore I spent almost 21 years
              of my life in various cantonments. The environment of the
              cantonment taught me to mix with different types of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am lucky in the sense that my passion and profession mingle with
              each other. I am passionate about solving real-world problems and
              interesting theoretical problems using my knowledge and experience
              in software. Yes, to be completely honest, I am a software guy. I
              do not like to work with hardware much. My goal is to learn and
              contribute to my area as much as I can, as long as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am passionate about learning and teaching math, science, and
              computer science. I am the Founding Member and academic
              coordinator of Trivuj Math Club and an Academic Member of
              Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee. This passion leads me
              to roam around the country to give lectures to inspire and prepare
              young minds on math, computer science.

                Hilbert Curve is a space-filling curve. That means this 1-D line
                can fill a 2-D space! This fact on its own is amazing! The
                mathematical and algorithmic knowledge inspired me to make
                something cool with it! In this project, the user can see the
                Hilbert Curve of various generations fill a 512x512 canvas. The
                hue mapping leads to a fascinating image of filled space. Uses
                can also upload their own image to be filled by Hilbert Curve
                which creates a mesmerizing atristic filter!

                This is a project to convert any Bangla or English number string
                into Bangladeshi number format which is the Crore-Lakh system.
                This project gives two APIs. Given a number string,
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'"
                  ><strong>getFormattedNumber</strong></span
                >
                would return another string that is thousand and hudred
                seperated by comma. Given a number string,
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'"
                  ><strong>convertToWord</strong></span
                >
                returns another string which is the number in word.

                In this prohect, data is received as JSON then the data is shown
                in a table. Here the dataset attribute of HTML5 is used to store
                the data in tr tag. Shown data then can be selected and moved to
                another table. The added data can also be removed. Also, the
                added data is maintained is a javascript Map. This allows to get
                added data from this map.

                Mancala is a two-player turn-based strategy board game. In this
                project, I build an AI to play Mancala with Minimax algorithm
                and Alpha-Beta pruning. I used OOP to organize game states.
